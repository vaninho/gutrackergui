Update 10/06/22
Looks like the game changed the way it logs things, then the tracker stop working. Im not sure if I will update the tracker since Im not playing the game with the same enthusiasm I had before. So, feel free to do it if you want to. I want to thank you guys for more than 125 downloads. I didnt realize when I started the project it will be a lot of people trusting on it.. so, thank you again :)


 GU Tracker

Its a tracker to game Gods Unchained.
Its made with electron/react mainly.
How this works? He gets informations about the opponent with Gods Unchained API and then show the probabily deck the opponent is using.
But it isnt against the rules?
No its not, at least I asked at discord and never received a negative. If it became prohibited, I will be removing this project.
But its not unfair?
Well, if you play the game, you gonna see a lot of players hidding his names using special characters, why that?
Because they are looking at gudecks.com and trying to know what the deck their opponent are using, if they dont know it, they never hid their names. So we only equalizing to everyone. And yes, the tracker gets the information even to this hidden names.

That's it, I hope you enjoy the tracker.

-- Changelog v2
With this release we just recode all the tracker.
Now we are not using web scraping at all, so we are not using the puppeteer anymore. With this the size of our setup decresead a lot.
With this we are now independent of gudecks.com, we are getting all information from the API from gods unchained gaining a lot of speed.
We have now a new feature called Debug, since I received some reports about the tracker not working on some PCs, with this I hope to understand what is happening.

-- Changelog v1.1.0
Improved speed, now using a decode on gods unchained deck string
